# Simple Johari Window App

This project is a simple, intuitive application designed to help users improve their **self-awareness** and **interpersonal communication** using the psychological model of the **Johari Window**.

## How It Works

The app provides a straightforward way to understand how you see yourself versus how others see you. By sorting a list of adjectives into four distinct quadrants, you can visually explore your public persona, private thoughts, and blind spots.

## Key Features

* **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Users can easily sort a list of adjectives into the four quadrants of the Johari Window based on their self-perception.
* **Peer Feedback:** The app generates a unique shareable link, allowing friends, family, or colleagues to provide their own perspective by sorting the same adjectives.
* **Revealing Insights:** After receiving peer input, the application visually compares self-perception with others' views, helping users identify their **blind spots** and expand their **open area**.

This project provides a straightforward, interactive way to gain valuable insights into how one is perceived by others, fostering personal growth and more effective relationships.
